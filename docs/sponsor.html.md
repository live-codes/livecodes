# Sponsor LiveCodes

Thank you for considering becoming a sponsor of LiveCodes! 💚

LiveCodes is a feature-rich, open source code playground with a wide range of language support. With LiveCodes, learning, prototyping, experimenting, documenting, teaching, and sharing code is easier and more enjoyable than ever.

LiveCodes is free, with no limits for use, no ads and no account required. The MIT license allows anyone to use (including commercial use), modify, and distribute.

As a sponsor of LiveCodes, you will be supporting the ongoing development and maintenance of the project, as well as helping to ensure that it remains a valuable resource for the developer community. In return, you will receive recognition as a sponsor on the documentation website, GitHub repo and social media channels, as well as the opportunity to engage with our community of users and contributors.

There are several ways to support LiveCodes as a sponsor:
