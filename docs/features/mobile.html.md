# Mobile Support

LiveCodes provides a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Don't wait to be on your desk. Try your ideas on the go!

Projects that you create on mobile can be easily [shared](./share.html.md) or [synchronized](./sync.html.md) across devices. You can even share using QR code.

By default, LiveCodes uses the touch-friendly [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/) editor on mobile. This is configurable in the [editor settings](./editor-settings.html.md) and can be changed at any time.
