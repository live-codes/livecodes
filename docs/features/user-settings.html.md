# User Settings

A user can select various settings that are stored locally in the browser and are subsequently used.

User settings can be configured in Settings menu. These include settings like:

- Auto-update
- Auto-save
- Delay (before auto-update and auto-save)
- [Format on-save](./code-format.html.md)#format-on-save)
- [Theme](./themes.html.md) (light/dark)
- [Theme color](./themes.html.md)#theme-color)
- [Recover unsaved projects](./recover.html.md)
- [Show spacing](./result.html.md)#show-spacings)
- Layout (responsive/vertical/horizontal)
- [Sync](./sync.html.md)
- Show [welcome screen](./welcome.html.md)
- [App language](./i18n.html.md)

The settings selected in the [`Editor Settings`](./editor-settings.html.md) screen are also saved locally as user settings.

User settings are scoped to the currently [logged-in user](./user-management.html.md). They can be [backed up/restored](./backup-restore.html.md) and [synced](./sync.html.md) the same as other user data ([projects](./projects.html.md), [user templates](./templates.html.md)#user-templates), [assets](./assets.html.md), [code snippets](./snippets.html.md)).
