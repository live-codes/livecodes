# Code to Image

LiveCodes has a feature called "Code to Image" that allows converting the code in the code editor into nice-looking images (or code screenshots), that can be downloaded or shared.

This can be accessed from the camera icon in the toolbar below the editor. Clicking the icon will open the "Code to Image" screen and load the code in the editor.

Code can be modified in the "Code to Image" screen and then downloaded as image or shared.

There are many options to configure the image to be generated, including background color, border radius, image size, padding, shadow, window style, share URL, editor theme, opacity, code font, image format, etc.

There are multiple presets that can be used or the options can be manually configured.
