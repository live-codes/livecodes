# Editor Settings

LiveCodes allows a lot of flexibility for configuring which code editor to use and its settings.

`Editor Settings` screen can be accessed from Settings menu â†’ Editor Settings.

import RunInLiveCodes from '../../src/components/RunInLiveCodes.tsx';

<RunInLiveCodes params={{ screen: 'editor-settings' }} linkText="direct link" />

A preview code editor is displayed to preview the settings in real time.

The settings selected in the `Editor Settings` screen are saved locally to [user settings](./user-settings.html.md) and are used subsequently. These include:

### Enable AI Code Assistant

Enables the [AI code assistant](./ai.html.md). (Free and no account required)

### Code Editor

The following code editors are supported:

- [**Monaco Editor**](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/): This is the code editor that powers [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is [feature-rich](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics) and supports autocomplete with [**IntelliSense**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) (including [types for custom libraries](./intellisense.html.md)). However, it requires a relatively large download and is not supported in mobile browsers.
- [**CodeMirror**](https://codemirror.net/): Has [many editing features](https://codemirror.net/docs/extensions/), including autocomplete, with good **mobile support**.
- [**CodeJar**](https://medv.io/codejar/): A **lightweight** code editor with very basic editing features. [PrismJs](https://prismjs.com/) is used for syntax highlighting. Please note that some editor settings are not supported in CodeJar (see below).

This can be configured using the [`editor`](../configuration/configuration-object.html.md)#editor) configuration option.

By default, Monaco editor is used on desktop, CodeMirror is used on mobile and CodeJar is used in [codeblocks](./display-modes.html.md)#codeblock), in [lite mode](./lite.html.md) and in [readonly](../configuration/configuration-object.html.md)#readonly) playgrounds.
