# Code Snippets

LiveCodes supports saving and organizing code snippets in different languages.

Code snippets are saved locally on user's device. However, they are supported in [sync](./sync.html.md), [backup](./backup-restore.html.md)#backup) and [restore](./backup-restore.html.md)#restore).

Code snippets screen can be accessed from Settings menu â†’ Code Snippets.

import RunInLiveCodes from '../../src/components/RunInLiveCodes.tsx';

<RunInLiveCodes params={{ screen: 'snippets' }} linkText="direct link" />

Each snippet has a title, description, language and code.

After adding snippets they can be sorted (by date modified or title), filtered (by language) or searched.
