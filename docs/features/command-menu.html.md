# Command Menu

The command menu allows running a large set of commands from the UI. It is keyboard-friendly and allows for searching and selecting commands. Most of the functionality of LiveCodes can be achieved using the command menu, which can really improve productivity and DX.

It can be triggered from the keyboard by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on Mac), or from the Help Menu.

The available commands cover a wide range of functionality, like showing and hiding UI elements (e.g. different editors, the [result page](./result.html.md), [console](./console.html.md), [compiled code viewer](./compiled-code.html.md), and [tests](./tests.html.md)), changing [languages](../languages), loading [starter templates](./templates.html.md), opening different screens (e.g. new project, opening saved projects, [import](./import.html.md), [embeds](./embeds.html.md), [deploy](./deploy.html.md), [share](./share.html.md) and more).
In addition many commands can be executed from the command menu, such as running code, formatting code, changing settings (e.g. autorun, autosave, changing [themes](./themes.html.md), [editor settings](./editor-settings.html.md), and more).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

If a command has a keyboard shortcut, it will be shown in the command menu. In addition, the whole list of keyboard shortcuts can be opened from the command menu (by searching for "Keyboard Shortcuts") or from the UI from the Help Menu.
