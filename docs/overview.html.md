# Overview

[LiveCodes](https://livecodes.io) is an [open-source](./license.html.md) client-side code playground. It is [feature-rich](./features/index.html.md) with support for [90+ languages/frameworks](./languages/index.html.md). It can be used as a [standalone app](./getting-started.html.md)#standalone-app) or [embedded](./features/embeds.html.md) in any web page. A powerful [SDK](./sdk/index.html.md) is available to facilitate embedding and communication with embedded playgrounds.

The sections below include the documentation details:
