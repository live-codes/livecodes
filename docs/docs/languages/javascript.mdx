# JavaScript

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a versatile, interpreted programming language that powers the dynamic behavior on most websites. 

LiveCodes runs JavaScript natively in the browser.Since JavaScript runs in the browser, it has a host environment with access to the DOM and other Web APIs, but it does not have Node.js features such as the file system or process information.

## Demo

import LiveCodes from '../../src/components/LiveCodes.tsx';

export const params = {
  template:"Javascript",
  console:"open"
};

<LiveCodes params={params}></LiveCodes>

## Usage

LiveCodes executes JavaScript directly in the browser.

You can use it to test and demonstrate JavaScript code that interacts with the DOM, fetch APIs, or manipulate HTML elements dynamically.

### Loading Modules

Most of the core functionality in JavaScript is available directly in the browser without any additional installation.

#### Standard Library

JavaScript provides a standard set of built-in objects and functions which are available directly in the browser.

#### External Packages
To use additional functionality not included in the core language, you can import external packages (libraries) from CDN links.

```js
import _ from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash-es@4.17.21/lodash.min.js';

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(_.shuffle(arr)); // shuffle the array
```

If you use JavaScript syntax extensions like JSX or JavaScript libraries/frameworks, you can select them directly in the programming language selection.
