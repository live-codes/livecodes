# GitHub Action âš¡

The [Preview in LiveCodes](https://github.com/live-codes/preview-in-livecodes) GitHub Action generates preview links to playgrounds for code changes in pull requests and posts them as pull request comments.

Once added to a repo, it runs when a pull request is created or updated. The new code is optionally built. The action posts in a pull request comment links to playgrounds that can use the new code.
