# GitHub Integration

Generally, LiveCodes can be used anonymously without any accounts. This includes [importing](./import.mdx) code from GitHub gists or public repos.

However, some features do require [login](./user-management.mdx) with a GitHub account and giving [specific permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) to make use of GitHub services (e.g. [import](./import.mdx) from private repos, [export](./export.mdx) to gist, [deploy](./deploy.mdx), [assets](./assets.mdx) and [sync](./sync.mdx)).
