# Editor Settings

LiveCodes allows a lot of flexibility for configuring which code editor to use and its settings.

`Editor Settings` screen can be accessed from Settings menu → Editor Settings.

import RunInLiveCodes from '../../src/components/RunInLiveCodes.tsx';

<RunInLiveCodes params={{ screen: 'editor-settings' }} linkText="direct link" />

A preview code editor is displayed to preview the settings in real time.

The settings selected in the `Editor Settings` screen are saved locally to [user settings](./user-settings.mdx) and are used subsequently. These include:
{/*

### Code Editor

The following code editors are supported:

- [**Monaco Editor**](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/): This is the code editor that powers [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is [feature-rich](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics) and supports autocomplete with [**IntelliSense**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) (including [types for custom libraries](./intellisense.mdx)). However, it requires a relatively large download and is not supported in mobile browsers.
- [**CodeMirror**](https://codemirror.net/): Has [many editing features](https://codemirror.net/docs/extensions/), including autocomplete, with good **mobile support**.
- [**CodeJar**](https://medv.io/codejar/): A **lightweight** code editor with very basic editing features. [PrismJs](https://prismjs.com/) is used for syntax highlighting. Please note that some editor settings are not supported in CodeJar (see below).

This can be configured using the [`editor`](../configuration/configuration-object.mdx#editor) configuration option.

By default, Monaco editor is used on desktop, CodeMirror is used on mobile and CodeJar is used in [codeblocks](./display-modes.mdx#codeblock), in [lite mode](./lite.mdx) and in [readonly](../configuration/configuration-object.mdx#readonly) playgrounds.

### Editor Options

These include:

- [Editor theme](../configuration/configuration-object.mdx#editortheme)

(Not supported in CodeJar)

### Editor Modes

(Not supported in CodeJar)

### Format Options

These are [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/) [configuration options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) used for code formatting.

In addition to those specified in [Editor Options](#editor-options), the following options are available:
