# Keyboard Shortcuts

Many commands can be executed from the keyboard using keyboard shortcuts. The full list can be found in the [Keyboard Shortcuts screen](https://livecodes.io/?screen=keyboard-shortcuts), which can be accessed from the Help Menu or from the [command menu](./command-menu.md) by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on Mac) and searching for "Keyboard Shortcuts".

The code editor shortcuts are the same as VS Code, which can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_basic-editing).
