# Export

## Exporting A Single Project

Project export can be accessed from the Project menu → Export.

Any project can be exported to:

- **Project (JSON):** a JSON file containing project [configuration object](../configuration/configuration-object.mdx). This can be used to later [import](./import.mdx#import-exported-livecodes-projects) that project on the same or a different device or to share a copy of the project with others.
- **Source (ZIP):** a zip file containing the project configuration file as JSON, in addition to the source code in separate files. This can be useful for opening the code in an external IDE.
- **Result (HTML):** [result page](./result.mdx) as a single html file. Can be used for the purpose of demo or deploy.
- **GitHub gist** (_requires login with [GitHub account](./github-integration.mdx)_): creates a **public** GitHub gist on the user's GitHub account containing the source code as separate files.
- **CodePen:** creates a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) prefilled with the project code. If the used [languages/frameworks](./../languages/index.mdx) are not supported in CodePen (e.g. Astro, Svelte, Python, ...etc), the compiled code is exported so that it continues to work there. [Bare module imports](./module-resolution.mdx) are converted to esm imports, for example:

  ```js

  ```

  becomes:

  ```js
  import React from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react';
  ```

- **JSFiddle:** creates a [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) prefilled with the project code. Exported code may be modified like with CodePen (see above).

## Exporting Multiple Projects

Multiple projects can be exported in bulk from the [Saved Projects](./projects.mdx) screen (Project menu → Open) using the button `Export All`.

This produces a JSON file containing an array of project configuration objects. They can be later imported in the same or a different device using the `Bulk Import` functionality in the [Import screen](./import.mdx#import-exported-livecodes-projects).

All the currently visible projects will be exported. If projects are filtered (e.g. by language, tag or search query), only the shown projects are exported.
