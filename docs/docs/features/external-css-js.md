# External CSS/JS

URLs to external CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files can be added to the page from the UI using the settings menu â†’ External CSS/JS. There, URLs can be added (each in a separate line).

These are loaded before the editor codes. You can override CSS properties in them. Global javascript variables defined there should be available to your code.

Importing and Exporting your code to other services (e.g. Codepen and Github gists) takes into consiedration the external resources.
