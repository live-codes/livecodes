# Code Snippets

LiveCodes supports saving and organizing code snippets in different languages.

Code snippets are saved locally on user's device. However, they are supported in [sync](./sync.md), [backup](./backup-restore.md#backup) and [restore](./backup-restore.md#restore).

Code snippets UI can be accessed from settings menu â†’ Code Snippets.

Each snippet has a title, description, language and code.

After adding snippets they can be sorted (by date modified or title), filtered (by language) or searched.

Clicking on a snippet causes the code to be copied to clipboard. This can then be pasted in projects.
