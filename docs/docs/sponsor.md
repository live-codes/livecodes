# Sponsor LiveCodes

Thank you for considering becoming a sponsor of LiveCodes!

LiveCodes is an open source application that allows users to collaborate on code in real time. It is MIT-licensed, which means that it is freely available for anyone to use (including commercial use), modify, and distribute.

As a sponsor of LiveCodes, you will be supporting the ongoing development and maintenance of the project, as well as helping to ensure that it remains a valuable resource for the developer community. In return, you will receive recognition as a sponsor on the documentation website, GitHub repo and social media channels, as well as the opportunity to engage with our community of users and contributors.

There are several ways to support LiveCodes as a sponsor:

### Financial Contributions

LiveCodes relies on the support of sponsors like you to fund its ongoing development and maintenance. Your financial contribution will help to ensure that the project remains sustainable in the long term.

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hatemhosny/)
- [PayPal](https://paypal.me/hatemhosni)

Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted. Recurring sponsorships are entitled to logo placements as specified in [Sponsorship Benefits](#sponsorship-benefits).
