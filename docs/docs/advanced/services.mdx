# Services

LiveCodes (being a client-side app) uses multiple services (for example for authentication, sharing, module resolution, etc).

These services are [defined here](https://github.com/live-codes/livecodes/tree/develop/src/livecodes/services).

Some of the services are not supported on [self-hosted](../features/self-hosting.mdx) deploys and are either replaced by other compatible services or require you to provide an alternative service.

Examples:

- The [share](../features/share.mdx) service in [self-hosted](../features/self-hosting.mdx) apps uses [dpaste](https://dpaste.com/) for short URLs, which are [**deleted after 365 days**](https://dpaste.com/help).
- [Firebase configuration](https://github.com/live-codes/livecodes/tree/develop/src/livecodes/services/firebase.ts) for authentication.

:::info

LiveCodes [sponsors](../sponsor.mdx) (Bronze sponsors and above) get access to managed custom services.

:::

If you [self-host](../features/self-hosting.mdx) your app and need to change any of these services, start by following the [guide described there](../features/self-hosting.mdx).

Then, edit the services you want (in [`src/livecodes/services`](https://github.com/live-codes/livecodes/tree/develop/src/livecodes/services)). The used services need to have the same interface.

The app then needs to be re-built using the command:

```shell
npm run build
```

The built app is in `build` directory. This can be hosted on any static file server.
