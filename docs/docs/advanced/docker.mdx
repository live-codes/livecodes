# Docker Setup

This guide makes it easy to set up a self-hosted instance of LiveCodes on a <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym> using Docker.

## Why?

LiveCodes is a [client-side app](../why.mdx#client-side). It can be easily self-hosted on any static file server or <acronym title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</acronym> (See [Self-Hosting guide](../features/self-hosting.mdx)).

All core functionalities (e.g. editors, compilers, formatters, code execution, etc) run in the browser.
However, some features require [external services](./services.mdx) which depend on server-side implementations (e.g. [sharing](../features/share.mdx) short URLs, [broadcast server](../features/broadcast.mdx), etc).
The docker setup described here provides out-of-the-box implementations for self-hosting these services.
See below for the list of provided [services](#services).

This allows self-hosted instances to have the same features as the hosted app ([livecodes.io](https://livecodes.io)).

:::warning Note
Most self-hosted instances will not require this setup. The static app should work just fine using other simpler [self-hosting methods](../features/self-hosting.mdx#guide).
Only use the docker setup if you need to self-host [these services](#services).
:::

## Example

This is an example of a self-hosted instance deployed to a VPS using the included Docker setup:

https://vps.livecodes.io/

Setting it up can be as simple as running the following command:

```sh
HOST_NAME=vps.livecodes.io docker compose up --build -d
```

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose ([installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
- Git: optional - for pulling updates ([installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))

## Getting Started

:::info note
When running in a non-local environment (e.g. VPS),
make sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records properly point to the machine public IP **before** running the docker containers.
The hostname should be set using [environment variables](#environment-variables).
:::

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/live-codes/livecodes.git
```

Enter the directory:

```sh
cd livecodes
```

Optionally, checkout a specific branch:

```sh
git checkout main
```

Run docker compose:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

By default, the app is served at https://livecodes.localhost <br />
(Yes, `localhost` can be served over HTTPS and have subdomains!).

The hostname and many other options can be set using [environment variables](#environment-variables).

## Services

- Automatic HTTPS

  This is provided by [Caddy server](https://caddyserver.com), which automatically obtains and renews TLS certificates.
  Local addresses (e.g. `localhost`, `livecodes.localhost`) are served over HTTPS using locally-trusted certificates.

- [Open Graph meta tags](https://ogp.me/)

  Provide project-specific meta tags, for social media cards.

- [oEmbed](https://oembed.com/)

  Allows embedded representations on third party sites.

- Adding [headers](https://github.com/live-codes/livecodes/blob/develop/src/_headers)

  e.g. aggressive caching of static assets for improved performance.

- [Short-URL share service](../features/share.mdx)

  Generates a short URL that can be shared. The project config is stored in a [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) store (a Redis fork with a permissive open-source license).
  Data is persisted to disk every 60 seconds (See [Volumes](#volumes) section below).

- [Broadcast server](../features/broadcast.mdx)

  Broadcasts updates to connected clients.

- CORS proxy

  Allows [importing content](../features/import.mdx) from external URLs.

- Separate origin sandbox

  Runs code in a separate origin [sandboxed iframe](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/sandboxed-iframes/) to prevent cross-site scripting.

- Local modules

  See [Local Modules](#local-modules) section for details.

- [404 page](https://livecodes.io/404)

  Custom 404 page for resources that are not found.

## Local Modules

(EXPERIMENTAL)

LiveCodes depends on a large number of external modules to support a wide range of features (e.g. code editors, compilers, formatters, etc).
These modules are loaded from CDNs (e.g. [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/), etc).
So, in spite of being a client-side app, LiveCodes requires an internet connection to load these modules.

However, if you want to be able to run LiveCodes without an internet connection, you can download all these modules locally by setting the [environment variable](#environment-variables) `LOCAL_MODULES=true` (it is set to `false` by default).
In this case, all modules are downloaded during build (~ 1.5 GB), and are served locally.

When working without internet connection, all resources have to be available locally. So, automatic [module resolution](../features/module-resolution.mdx) (e.g. of npm modules imported in user code) and loading type definitions for [intellisense](../features/intellisense.mdx) and auto-complete will not work out of the box.
However, you can provide the list of modules to load using the [`imports`](../configuration/configuration-object.mdx#imports) property of the [config](../configuration/configuration-object.mdx) object (see [Custom Module Resolution](../features/module-resolution.mdx#custom-module-resolution)).
Similarly, you can also provide the list of type definitions to load using the [`types`](../configuration/configuration-object.mdx#types) property (see [Custom Types](../features/intellisense.mdx#custom-types)).
These modules and type definitions should be prepared in advance and made available to the running app (e.g. in the `/assets` directory - see [Volumes](#volumes)).

Example:

To run [React starter template](https://livecodes.io/?template=react) locally without internet connection, you need to:

(assuming that the app is running on this URL: https://livecodes.localhost/)

- Add [these files](https://github.com/hatemhosny/custom-modules-demo/tree/main/modules) to the [`/assets` directory](#volumes).
- Open React starter template: https://livecodes.localhost/?template=react
- Add this code to custom settings (Project menu → Custom Settings):

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "react": "https://livecodes.localhost/assets/react.js",
    "react/compiler-runtime": "https://livecodes.localhost/assets/react-compiler-runtime.js",
    "react/jsx-runtime": "https://livecodes.localhost/assets/react-jsx-runtime.js",
    "react-dom": "https://livecodes.localhost/assets/react-dom.js",
    "react-dom/client": "https://livecodes.localhost/assets/react-dom-client.js",
    "scheduler": "https://livecodes.localhost/assets/scheduler.js"
  },
  "types": {
    "react": "https://livecodes.localhost/assets/react.d.ts"
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

The app can be customized by setting different environment variables.


Environment variables can be defined in a `.env` file in the root of the repository (on the same level as `docker-compose.yml`).

```txt title=".env"
HOST_NAME=playground.website.com
```

Please note that some variables are used **during build**. So after setting environment variables, the app needs to be rebuilt. e.g.:

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

The following environment variables are supported:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HOST_NAME` | Hostname of the app | `livecodes.localhost` |
| `PORT` | Port of the app | `443` |
| `SELF_HOSTED_SHARE` | Enable [share service](../features/share.mdx) | `true` |
| `SELF_HOSTED_BROADCAST` | Enable [broadcast server](../features/broadcast.mdx) | `true` |
| `BROADCAST_PORT` | Port of the broadcast server | `3030` |
| `BROADCAST_TOKENS` | Comma-separated list of broadcast [user tokens](../features/broadcast.mdx#technical-details) | |
| `SANDBOX_HOST_NAME` | Hostname of the sandbox | `$HOST_NAME` |
| `SANDBOX_PORT` | Port of the sandbox | `8090` |
| `FIREBASE_CONFIG` | [Firebase config object](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object) (JSON), used for [authentication](../features/github-integration.mdx) | |
| `DOCS_BASE_URL` | [Base URL](../features/self-hosting.mdx#custom-build) of the documentation (e.g. `/docs/`) | `null` |
| `LOG_URL` | Full URL to send [server-side analytics](https://github.com/live-codes/livecodes/blob/develop/functions/index.ts) (e.g. `https://api.website.com/log`) | `null` |
| `LOCAL_MODULES` | Download and use all modules locally (see [Local Modules](#local-modules)) | `false` |

:::info note
When running in a non-local environment (e.g. VPS),
setting the `HOST_NAME` environment variable is **required**. It should match the domain name set in [DNS records](#getting-started).
:::

## Volumes

The following docker [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) are used:

- `./assets` - A [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) for static assets that get served under the app URL (`/assets/`). This can be used to serve images, stylesheets, [custom modules](../features/module-resolution.mdx#custom-module-resolution), [custom types](../features/intellisense.mdx#custom-types), etc.
- `livecodes-share-data` - A [named volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) where persistent data for the share service is saved. Make sure to **backup** this.

for VOLUME in "${VOLUMES[@]}"; do
  echo "Restoring $VOLUME..."
  docker volume create $VOLUME
  docker run --rm \
    -v $VOLUME:/data \
    -v $(pwd)/$BACKUP_DIR:/backup \
    alpine \
    tar xvf /backup/$VOLUME.tar -C /data --strip 1
done

echo "Restore complete."
```

## Deployment

For continuous deployment, you can use the included [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/live-codes/livecodes/blob/develop/.github/workflows/docker-deploy.yml) to deploy to a VPS when a new commit is pushed (e.g. to the `main` branch).

This assumses that you have followed the [Getting Started](#getting-started) instructions and have cloned the repo to your VPS.

The workflow uses [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) and [variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables) from your GitHub repo settings for SSH access and setting required [environment variables](#environment-variables).
