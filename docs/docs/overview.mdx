# Overview

[LiveCodes](https://livecodes.io) is an [open-source](./license.mdx) client-side code playground. It is [feature-rich](./features/index.mdx) with support for [90+ languages/frameworks](./languages/index.mdx). It can be used as a [standalone app](./getting-started.mdx#standalone-app) or [embedded](./features/embeds.mdx) in any web page. A powerful [SDK](./sdk/index.mdx) is available to facilitate embedding and communication with embedded playgrounds.

The sections below include the documentation details:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
