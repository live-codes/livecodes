  Original version by Quanfei Wan, 1997
  Modifications by Kevin J. Brewer, 1998/08/20 to 1998/09/21

   - Corrected exponential ranges to those specified in IEEE-754.
   - Correction of decimal exponent field size.
   - Made correction so that decimal significand is displayed even when
     its value is 0.
   - decBinVal array sizes corrected for small values (those near 1.0*2**-126
     for 32-bit or 1.0*2**-1022 for 64-bit).
   - Corrected ieee32.Convert2Dec() to ieee64.Convert2Dec() in the ieee64
     section.
   - Added support for zero and denormalized numbers (those less than
     1.0*2**-126 for 32-bit or 1.0*2**-1022 for 64-bit).
   - Modified significand input field to hold the notationally largest range
     input value (with the most significant digits, exponent, and signs),
     -4.94065645841246544E-324 .
   - Use only 1 set of intBinVal and decBinVal arrays so that 32-bit results
     will be marked invalid when 64-bit values greater than 3.40282347E38
     are entered.
   - Joined arrays intBinVal and decBinVal into one array, BinVal, in order
     to ease the manipulations involved in rounding.

   - Added IEEE-754 round-to-nearest value rounding mode.

   - Added input echo field which displays how the host machine sees the
     input value (round-off, number of significant digits, max and min
     exponentials, etc.).
   - For both precisions, added an echo field which displays the input value
     accurate to the number of bits in that precision's significand.
   - Added action so that when an input value overflows a precision, set that
     precision's outputs to the precision's Infinity values instead of having
     the bits be replaced by "#"s.
   - For both precisions, added a status field indicating from high to low:
     overflow, normal, denormalized, underflow, and normal for zero.
   - Run Convert2Bin() only once per precision (not for each substring).
   - Added the ability to round or not to round by providing 2 activation
     buttons labeled as such.
   - Reduced exponent input field to hold up to the notationally largest
     exponent value (with the most significant digits and sign), -324, unless
     someone wants to oddly decimalize (add fractional/decimal parts to) the
     exponent.
   - Replaced calls to round() with tests and corrections for rounding up to
     calls to floor() which always rounds down.

   1998/09/28 to 1998/09/30

   - Made BinVal external to Convert2Bin (and therefore local to function ieee)
     as this.BinVal as is required in IEEE-754hex64.html and IEEE-754hex32.html
     so that Unix 'diff' has some chance at comparing this file with
     IEEE-754hex64.html or IEEE-754hex32.html .
   - General clean-ups.
   - Removed the optional "Exponent:" input field due to its problem of causing
     the entire input to underflow to zero when its value is -324, the problems
     encountered when trying to correct this deficiency programatically, and
     its superfluousness due to the ability of entering scientific notation
     (4.94065645841246544E-324) into the "Significand:" field alone.
   - Renamed the "Significand:" input field to "Decimal Floating-Point:".

   1998/10/06 to 1998/10/07

   - Added removal of input leading and trailing blanks by adding RemoveBlanks
     routine.
   - Added converting all floating-point inputs into canonical form (scientific
     notation, +x.xxE+xxxx form) with constant exponential width and plus sign
     usage by adding the Canonical routine, in order to simplify the string
     number comparisons involved in the 1.7976931348623157E+308 overflow check.
   - Found and corrected bug in both binary outputs created by some unknown
     JavaScript scoping problem for the symbol 'output' by introduction of the
     Canonical routine (never in a released version).

   - Floating-point input is now hand parsed and then its magnitude is compared
     against +1.7976931348623157E+00308 in the OvfCheck routine.  If the
     magnitude is greater than this value (compared as a string), set all
     outputs to the appropriate Infinity values.  The JavaScript implementation
     of IEEE-754 64-bit precision clips such values at 1.7976931348623157E+308.

   - Greatly improved the efficiency of the Convert2Hex routine.

   1998/10/20

   - Allow power of 10 indicator in numStrClipOff to be "E" as well as "e" in
     case not all browsers use "e".
   - Reordered 'numerals' in OvfCheck so that their index (value) is the same
     as that which the numeral represents.

   1998/10/23

   - With hand parsed floating-point input, compare its magnitude against
     +2.4703282292062328E-00324 in the UndfCheck routine.  If the magnitude is
     less than this value (compared as a string), set 'this.StatCond' to
     "underflow".  The JavaScript implementation of IEEE-754 64-bit precision
     underflows such values to zero.
   - The above required all settings of 'this.StatCond' to "normal" to have to
     be removed, "normal" rather than "error" is now the default.
   - With hand parsed input, set the output sign bit from its minus sign
     character before the input is turned into a numeric.  This supports input
     of negative zeros, "-0", and those values which underflow to it.

   1998/10/28

   - The central testing section of OvfCheck and UndfCheck were joined together
     as the single routine A_gt_B.
   - The translation which moves an input's base 10 exponential (the sign and
     value to the right of the "E") to its left end as its sign and most
     significant digits is now performed by the MostSigOrder routine.
   - Due to tests now involving negative exponentials in A_gt_B (via UndfCheck),
     a bias of 50,000 is added to all exponentials, when moved by MostSigOrder,
     in order to simplify numeric compares performed as iterative comparisons of
     individual digits in strings.

   1998/10/29

   - Floating-point input is now hand parsed, manipulated, and placed into the
     this.BinVal array only once by introduction of the Dec2Bin routine.
     As a result, the Convert2Bin routine now used is quite similar to that of
     IEEE-754hex64.html and IEEE-754hex32.html .

   1999/03/04

   - Corrected displaying error in numStrClipOff when the number of digits of
     precision for a particular IEEE-754 format is less than the number of
     digits returned by the system (before the value is large enough that the
     system returns it in "E" notation).
     Error found by Bill Maxwell (billmax@compuserve.com).

   1999/03/05

   - The system returns values such as 1.0E21 simply as 1E21.  In numStrClipOff,
     made adjustments to correct the display output when the system returns such
     values.
     Due to the idealized nature of the input to numStrClipOff vs. that of
     Canonical, many simplifications to the code in numStrClipOff were made.

   - Added a Clear button next to the input field which clears the input field
     and all result fields.

   1999/05/17

   - Removed <FONT FACE="Arial"> which is not displayed the same by all browser
     versions.

   - Balanced all <FONT> tags with </FONT> tags.

   - Removed all value layout comments since that information is much better
     presented in the IEEE-754references.html file.

   - Aligned all "Bit xx" and "Bits xx - xx" headings.

   - Replaced all occurrences of the term "unnormalized" with the term
     "denormalized" preferred by the standard.

   - Changed the "Decimal value of the exponent" display from "b + [e] = [f]"
     to "[f] - b = [e]" where b = 127 or b = 1023

   - Headings "Exponent" changed to "Exponent Field" and headings
     "Decimal value of the exponent" changed to
     "Decimal value of exponent field and exponent".

   1999/05/28

   - Rounded the 32-bit decimal significand just like the 32-bit full decimal
     value.

   - Fixed displaying problem in numStrClipOff in which values of
     0.000000099... and smaller (in 32-bit) are displayed as 0.0000000 because
     the values are not small enough for the system to return them in "E"
     notation and similarly for 0.000000000000000099... and smaller in 64-bit.
